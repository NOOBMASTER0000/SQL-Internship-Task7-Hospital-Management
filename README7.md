# HospitalDB Task 7

This repository contains SQL scripts for **Task 7** of the HospitalDB project.  
It demonstrates how to **create, use, and manage SQL Views** to simplify data access and improve security.

## Features
- Created views using complex `SELECT` queries.
- Demonstrated abstraction of multiple table joins through views.
- Showed how views can restrict columns for data security.
- Included examples for updating and dropping views.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `task7.sql` script in your SQL environment (MySQL/SQLite).
3. Use `SELECT * FROM view_name;` to view results.
4. Try updating or filtering data using the created views.

## Objective
Understand how **views** simplify complex queries,  
provide **data abstraction**, and help enforce **security and consistency** in databases.
